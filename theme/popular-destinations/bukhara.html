        <h3> Samanid Mausoleum</h3>

        <p>The Samanid Mausoleum (aka Ismail Samani Mausoleum) was built during the life of this ruler, one of the most
            prominent representatives of the dynasty, who ruled Bukhara from 892 to 907. Initially, the mausoleum was
            intended for the tomb of Ismail's father, Ahmad, but later became a tomb for all members of the royal
            family. This is oldest Muslim landmark in Bukhara and a real masterpiece of early Islamic architecture.</p>

        <h3> Minaret Kalyan</h3>

            alt="Kalon Minaret">
        <p> Another architectural symbol of Bukhara is the Kalyan Minaret. It was built at the beginning of the XII
            century and is a tall tower of burnt bricks 47 meters high. Its foundation goes down 10 meters. The main
            purpose of minaret is to call the Bukhara people to prayer. But its impressive height began to serve many
            other purposes. For example, it was a lighthouse in the sandy desert sea for lost caravans. A beautiful
            panorama of the area opened from here, which made it possible to calculate the enemy long before his
            approaches to the city. </p>
