        <p> Samarkand is considered as on of the oldest cities in the world, and it was a key point of the Great Silk
            Road, and many conquerors left their mark here. It is an amazing city. One cannot put this city's all beauty
            and wealth into the words. Samarkand has a long and dramatic story: Samarkand was almost wiped out by the
            Mongols of Genghis Khan, then Tamerlan brought him back to life and made the capital of his vast empire, and
            under Ulugbek, the grandson of Tamerlane, many madrasahs were built in the city, so it became educational
            capital of the East. Almost all the unique artichectural monuments of the times of Tamerlene have been
            preserved here to this day.</p>
