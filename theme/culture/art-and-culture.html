            <p> Music connects the cultures of the world and is a window into the ethos of any country. Likewise, Uzbek
                music is one of the keys to understanding Uzbek culture. Today in Tashkent and other cities of the
                country one can hear Uzbek contemporary pop music, folklore music, Uzbek neoclassicism, and special
                genres of Uzbek music - “shashmakom” and “lazgi”. Besides, uzbek folk music more generally is often
                associated with dutar and bakhshi. Dutar is a simple instrument with two silk strings and bakhshi is a
                musician playing this instrument while
                singing folk songs. Uzbek festive music is performed on a karnay (wind instrument), surnay (flute) and
                doira, the sounds of which can be heard for hundreds of meters, inviting locals and tourists alike to
                join in the celebration.</p>

            <p>Uzbek dances are the embodiment of the beauty of the Uzbek people. Uzbek folk dances differ from other
                oriental dances with a special emphasis on hand movements and facial expressions during performance. At
                the same time, each region has its own dance schools - in some, sharp movements predominate, in others -
                flowing, in some schools they use a short step, while others sometimes switch to a kind of running.
                Today there are three main schools of Uzbek dance - Khorezm, Bukhara and Ferghana. It is quite simple to
                see Uzbek dances, not a single celebration is complete without them and everyone loves to dance! </p>

            <p>Oriental masters have always been famous for their special artistic talent, which is fully manifested in
                the decoration and decoration of majestic palaces, mausoleums and other religious buildings. As a rule,
                the main motifs of Uzbek creativity are ornament, pattern and calligraphy. Islamic traditions prohibit
                the depiction of people and animals, so the masters began to develop more abstract directions, bringing
                them almost to perfection. Later, a new type of fine Uzbek art appeared - a miniature - small bright
                colorful pictures, varnished, adorned the interiors of palaces and rich houses.</p>

            <p> The decorative and applied art of Uzbekistan is an original and exclusive work of folk craftsmen and
                artisans who pass on their skills from generation to generation. By investing a piece of soul in every
                thing, over the centuries they have created unique patterns of products: whether it’s utensils for the
                home or decoration of the home, a unique fabric for a festive dress or special dishes. The creations of
                Ferghana, Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva and other masters have long been famous far beyond the borders of
                their homeland and continue to cause interest among lovers of beauty from around the world.</p>
